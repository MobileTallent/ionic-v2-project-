# Dev tools

To inspect the contents of the local WebSQL database when developing in Chrome, open up the development tools. (When running on the phone the SQLite database is used from a Cordova plugin instead of the WebSQL API)

# AngularJS

### AngularJS Performance

With great power comes great responsibility. Angular apps can have performance issues if you are not careful. This is
particularly important with the slower CPU's (and less memory) in mobile devices compared to desktop/laptop computers.

# Ionic

### AngularJS With Ionic

There is one key difference using AngularJS with Ionic that you must be aware of.

Ionic implements view caching which means:

* The Angular controller is not constructed each time
* The controller's $scope is detached from the angular lifecyle when it is cached and not active

The main change is in Angular controllers you will put logic into the Ionic events, such as $ionicView.beforeEnter. You will see many examples in the codebase.

See http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionView/ for the full details.

# Cordova

### Developing in the browser
Use the Chrome extention Cordova Mocks to provide mock data for common Cordova plugins

### Debugging on Android
While you can do most of the development in the desktop Chrome, should you need to debug Android issues then the following
resources will be of use:

## Development

When updating an object it is better to pass in a change set to save() and not to modifiy the object first and then call save()
so if the save fails then the object retains the original values

**Don't do this**

user.country = 'Australia'

return user.save()

**Do this**

var changeSet = {country : 'Australia'}
return user.save(changeSet)

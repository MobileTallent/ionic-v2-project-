# Checklist before publishing your initial version
* Splash screen and icon configured. See http://ionicframework.com/blog/automating-icons-and-splash-screens/
* Facebook permissions approved (test by logging in to the app with a Facebook account that is NOT an admin for the facebook app)
* Add the hash to the Facebook app in the Android settings
* Test the push notifications to a real iPhone to test the push notification configuration
* Create a public API key for your Google cloud project and add it to the google maps script in index.html
* Lock down the external network access in */config.xml* and the Content-Security-Policy meta tags in */www/index.html*. See the inline comments and https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-whitelist
* For iOS open up XCode and select the Push entitlement

# Checklist for submitting a build to the app stores
After you've completed your initial submission checklist, to upload a new (or first) version to the app stores remember to do the following:

We recommend doing the build for iOS and Android separately, i.e. provide a platform argument to the ionic build command, e.g. ionic build android --release
* Increment the version attributes in /config.xml
* Run **gulp prodBuild** to build with your production configuration
* Run **ionic build --release**
* Android - sign and align the .apk (See http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html to have the build do this for you)
* iOS - in XCode update the Version and Build number in Targets [Project Name] -> General -> Identity
* Deploy the Parse cloud code (change into the *CloudCode* dir and run **parse deploy prod**) and run any migration scripts required (If you want to test a migration script on the production data set then export your data from Parse and import it into a new app)
* If your new Android build gets the error "Session was closed and not closed normally." on Facebook login then you may need to add a hash to the Facebook app config
* If you have enabled ads in Android then in your Play Store app console select the option at **Pricing & Distribution** > **CONTAINS ADS** >  *Does your application have ads?*

# After publishing your first version

* Post on http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/what-are-you-building-with-ionic-we-want-to-know/12244/237
* Tell us about it!

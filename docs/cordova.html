# Cordova

Apache Cordova is the open source project that was donated from, and the basis of, Adobe PhoneGap.

It provides the ability to develop 'hybrid mobile apps' where the majority of the UI and logic is 
coded as a web appication in an embedded web view. Cordova provides the ability to interface with 
native code via a JavaScript interface.

Generally the project configuration commands you will use are adding/remove platforms (android, ios) and adding/removing plugins.

**cordova platform add ios**

**cordova platform remove ios**

**cordova platform add android**

**cordova platform remove android**

You should not edit anything under **/platforms/ios** or **/platforms/android**
It should be possible to remove and add the platforms back at any time.
If you do need to make tweaks, as we have had to in the Cloneder project, it should be done by
updating the plugins or by the cordova hooks.


## Cordova lifecycle hooks

Cordova has hooks which allows scripts to be run at various stages of development cycle, and are found in the folder **/hooks**

The cloneder project has a number of custom hooks to automate the project setup and configuration from common issues. (A number of the other hooks come from ionic-cli)

1. Remove duplicate bolts-android jars ([StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27694355/unable-to-execute-dex-multiple-dex-files-define-lbolts-aggregateexception?lq=1))
2. Add the android:name attribute to the application tag in AndroidManifest.xml for the CustomApplication ([Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23560414/apache-cordova-app-crashes-after-receiving-parse-com-push-notification/23574678))
3. Always install the facebook plugin from a local copy so it installs with the required variables ([StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22355792/cordova-facebook-plugin-missing-variables-app-id-app-name))

These have been tested on OS X (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-5905)


## Plugins

The ParsePushPlugin used in Cloneder is a fork maintained at my GitHub at https://github.com/campers/parse-push-plugin
which contains some customisations for opening notifications.

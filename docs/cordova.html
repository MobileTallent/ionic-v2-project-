# Cordova

Apache Cordova is the open source project that was donated from, and the basis of, Adobe PhoneGap.

It provides the ability to develop 'hybrid mobile apps' where the majority of the UI and logic is 
coded as a web appication in an embedded web view. Cordova provides the ability to interface with 
native code via a JavaScript interface.

Generally the project configuration commands you will use are adding/remove platforms (android, ios) and adding/removing plugins.

**ionic platform add ios**

**ionic platform remove ios**

**ionic platform add android**

**ionic platform remove android**

You should not edit anything under **/platforms/ios** or **/platforms/android**
It should be possible to remove and add the platforms back at any time.
If you do need to make tweaks, as we have had to in the Cloneder project, it should be done by
updating the plugins or by the cordova hooks.


## Cordova lifecycle hooks

Cordova has hooks which allows scripts to be run at various stages of development cycle, and are found in the folder **/hooks**

The Cloneder project has a number of custom hooks to automate the project setup and configuration from common issues. (A number of the other hooks come from ionic-cli)

1. Add the android:name attribute to the application tag in AndroidManifest.xml for the CustomApplication ([Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23560414/apache-cordova-app-crashes-after-receiving-parse-com-push-notification/23574678))
2. Ensure Gulp has run to copy the CustomApplication class source to in /platforms/android
3. Add a build-extras.gradle to the android project to fix dependancy conflicts between the Parse and Facebook plugin
4. Ensure a Gulp production build has been done before running the builds for the phones.

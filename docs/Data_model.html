# Domain Objects

As the default backend is Parse, the domain objects inherit the base properties from a Parse object. (See https://parse.com/docs/js/guide#objects-parse-object)

A primary key **id** of type **string**. (Note in the Parse datastore it is stored as **objectId**)

A **createdAt** and **updatedAt** property of type **Date**.

These three can be accessed as properties (e.g. *obj.createdAt*)

With the Parse SDK all other properties are meant to be get/set with *obj.set('property', value)* and *obj.get('property')*

However an module included in Cloneder updates the types to allow direct property access. (function enhance(prototype, fields) in service-parse.js)

The individual objects in the data model have been documented with JSDoc tags (similar to Javadoc for those with a Java
background) in the service-parse.js file.  For example the User object:

    /**
    * @typedef {Object} User
    * @property {boolean} emailVerified - the match object
    * @property {string[]} matches - an array of the ids of the Match objects that are a mutual match
    */
    var userFields = [
    'emailVerified', 'matches'
    ]


# Searching

The algorithm to search profiles is executed by the Parse cloud function **GetMatches** in */CloudCode/cloud/main.js* and
simply filters by the discovery preferences.

# Swiping

The code that process swipes is the Parse cloud function **ProcessMatch** in */CloudCode/cloud/main.js*

When a user is the first to swipe another user, this will create the initial Match object in the database. The Match
object has the properties uid1, uid2, profile1, profile2. The way the two users are assigned the 1 or 2 post-fixed properties
is by the ordering of their user id.  So a user with an id of AAAA will be uid1 if the other user id is ZZZZ. This
provides a way to consistent composite key to look up the Match object for two particular users.

The userAction1 and userAction2 values record what the action was from a particular user. The valid values are:

* **L** - the user liked the other user

* **R** - the user rejected/passed the other user

* **O** - the other user rejected this user first

The state property defined the current state of the match. The values are:

* **P** - Pending, i.e. the first user liked the other user, so waiting for the other user to like/reject

* **R** - Rejected. One of the users rejected/passed the other user

* **M** - Mutual match, both users liked each other

* **D** - Deleted/removed match. The users did have a mutual match, but one user removed the match.

# Match/Chat

A mutual match can be considered a group chat between two people.  In the code matchId and chatId has been used
interchangeably as variable/argument names.

When a Match is updated to be a mutual match, then the match id is saved to the **matches** property on both users
to allow efficient loading/synchronising of the mutual matches.  Note that the matches property cant grow unbounded
as a Parse  object has a maximum size of 128 KB in JSON format.

There is some complexity around the match and chat messages code due to the synchronizing between the server, 
local database and memory model. And also because data can start multiple ways - loading the cached data
from the db, synchronizing from the server, from a user action and from a push notification.

To allow efficient loading/synching of the chat messages (i.e. with an indexed query) the user ids
are stored in the array property ChatMessage.userIds. 
Also the senderName is denormalised onto the ChatMessage to avoid an additional API call to get the senders name
for the push notification.

## Group chat

The chat has been designed with group chat in mind, however there would need to be some changes to properly support it.

The members of the match/chat are the properties **uid1** and **uid2**. To support group chat there would need to be 
an array property with all the members of the chat.

When a user joins a chat then messages before the user joined would need to be loaded seperately as their user id
would not be in the older userIds property

Here's an email I wrote to a customer about how to implement group chat:


    Here's how I'd update the code in the simplest way to support group chat....

    In the code comments I often refer to the Match object as the Chat object (or chatId being the matchId) when talking about it as the parent of the ChatMessage, so think of the Match object as a Chat, which has many ChatMessages. (ChatMessage has a match field which is a pointer to the parent Match/Chat)
    (If I was creating the data model again I would probably split the Match into a SwipeAction and Chat object)

    Match has uid1 and uid2 which are the two members in the chat when there is a mutual match.

    To extend Match to support group chats you will need to add an array field called members which will initially be populated with the two user ids from a mutual match. You might also want to add a field called type to Match to easily differentiate it from a mutual match only chat to a group chat.

    By re-using the same object types you can keep the code which synchronises the data from the server without needing to change it.

    The User class has a matches field which has the ids of the mutual matches. You can think of that as the chats the user belongs to, and should always be updated when a user joins/removes from a group chat.

    The other considerations are sending push notifications to all members of the chat (there is already a comment in the cloud code about this on the line you would have to update).

    When a new ChatMessage is saved its userIds field needs to have all the current members (ie the value of Match.members). This allow efficient syncing of all new chat messages for a users.  However when a user joins a group chat the messages up to that point will not be synced. So on being added to a group there should be a query to load all the ChatMessages up to that point.

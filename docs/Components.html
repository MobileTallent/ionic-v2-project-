Cloneder is built upon many components and plugins.  A large part of the work in creating Cloneder is integrating
all the various components, testing them and making tweaks and fixes as required.

# Bower component customization notes

### Multi-range slider
The multi-range slider used for the age and search distance options is from https://github.com/PopSugar/angular-slider
This particular one was chosen over two others which were tested as it did not have a dependency on jQuery or ngTouch.
There was a conflict with a CSS name. The slider div class has been modified from *bar* to *slider-bar*
There are other css changes added to app.css to fix some styles
The bower.json was updated to include the css file

### Tinder cards
The line *swipeCards.partial(amt)* was commented out as it was causing a bad flickering issue when the drag speed goes to zero.

### Emoji
Some additional code was added to support the short forms of smilies.

### ngImgCrop
If you add jQuery to your project you will have a issue with the touch events. We developed a fix but its no longer
required as we removed the jQuery dependency, contact us if you need it.

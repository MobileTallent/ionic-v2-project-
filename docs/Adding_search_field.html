<title>Adding a new search filter</title>

Here is a quick guide to all the steps you will need to complete to add an additional search filter.

## Data model 

Let's start with the data model. Open up */app/js/service-parse.js* and look at the *profileFields* 
array which defines all the fields on the *Profile* model.

For example the gender, guys and girls fields work together, where gender defines what the 
user is ('M' or 'F') and guys/girls are booleans for the users search preference.

Add your additional fields here.

## Search query 

To have these fields affect the search query open up */CloudCode/cloud.main.js*

Go to the Cloud method defined as "GetMatches"

You will see the fragment of code which add the gender filter

```javascript
var gender = []
if(profile.guys)
	gender.push('M')
if(profile.girls)
	gender.push('F')
profileQuery.containedIn("gender", gender)
```

Add something similar to suit your search criteria

## UI/Application

### Editing the value

To allow the user to edit their value you will need to add the field to */app/templates/profileEdit.html*
and add code to the angular controller '*ProfileEdit*' in */app/js/controller-profile.ts*

In ProfileEdit.saveProfile() you will need to add the new attribute to the *profileUpdate* object.

### Updating the search preference

Next you need to allow the user to set their search preference for the field.
You will then need to update the angular controller *DiscoveryCtrl* and the view */app/js/controller-discovery.html*

### Required field validation

This step is required if you want to ensure the user has set the value for the new field when they register.

When a user first registers there is a function called *proceed()* in *controller-signin.js* which checks if all the minimum required
properties are set on the user. If not then the user is send to the *profileSetup.html* view. You may want to also add a check for your
new user property here if there is not a suitable default value to set.

## Local SQL storage

If you want the user to be able to view the new properties of their matches you will also need to store the value in the local database, which is done in */app/js/service-localdb.js*

This is required because the mutual matches, and the associated profile are saved in the local SQL database and loaded when app is restarted

You will need to make changes to three functions:

Update *function mapMatchResultSet(sqlResultSet)* to map the result set from the database row to the profile object

Update *function init()* to add the new column in the SQL statement which creates the match table. If you have already
publicly released a version of your app then you will have to add the column as a new migration, so existing users can
update their local database to have the new field.

Update *function saveMatch(match, profile)* by 1) adding the column name in the columns list, 2) add a *?* to the parameter list, 3) add the property value to the args array

Next you will also want to update the unit tests in */app/js/service-localdb_test.js* to write and read your new property

And that is basically it!

<title>Adding a new search filter</title>

Here is a quick guide to all the steps you will need to complete to add an additional search filter.

## Data model 

Let's start with the data model. Open up */app/js/service-parse.js* and look at the *profileFields* 
array which defines all the fields on the *Profile* model.

For example the gender, guys and girls fields work together, where gender defines what the 
user is ('M' or 'F') and guys/girls are booleans for the users search preference.

Add your additional fields here.

## Search query 

To have these fields affect the search query open up */CloudCode/cloud.main.js*

Go to the Cloud method defined as "GetMatches"

You will see the fragment of code which add the gender filter

```javascript
var gender = []
if(profile.guys)
	gender.push('M')
if(profile.girls)
	gender.push('F')
profileQuery.containedIn("gender", gender)
```

Add something similar to suit your search criteria

## UI/Application

### Editing the value

To allow the user to edit their value you will need to add the field to */app/templates/profileEdit.html*
and add code to the angular controller '*ProfileEdit*' in */app/js/profile/profile-edit.ts*

In ProfileEdit.saveProfile() you will need to add the new attribute to the *profileUpdate* object.

### Profile view

Update /app/app/js/profile/profile-details.html

This fragement is displayed in all the screen where a profile is viewed

### Updating the search preference

Next you need to allow the user to set their search preference for the field.
You will then need to update the angular controller *DiscoveryCtrl* and the view */app/js/controller-discovery.html*

### Required field validation

This step is required if you want to ensure the user has set the value for the new field when they register.

When a user first registers there is a function called *proceed()* in *controller-signin.js* which checks if all the minimum required
properties are set on the user. If not then the user is send to the *profileSetup.html* view. You may want to also add a check for your
new user property here if there is not a suitable default value to set.

## Overview


Gulp (http://gulpjs.com) is a streaming build system built with JavaScript and using node.js

The default gulp task with Ionic starter project is not suitable for production apps. 
A primary reason is because the bower_components folder is under the /www folder, which causes the builds to contain a large amount of unneccassary files
Also it doesn't contain any optimisations such as compression, concatintation, pre-built template caching, plumber etc

Instead of running **ionic serve** to build and start the http server, use the provided gulp script by running the command **gulp** in the project root.

Running **gulp** will run the default task, which is defined as:

```javascript
gulp.task('default', ['watch', 'sass', 'css', 'js', 'lib', 'lib-css', 'templates', 'fonts', 'images', 'http']);
```

Gulp will run these tasks in parallel.  The **js** task defines a dependancy on the **envConfig** which needs to run first.

# Watching

When you run gulp, it will not exit, but wait watching for changes to the files and re-run the tasks. The watching is configured in the **watch** task:
```javascript
gulp.task('watch', function() {
    gulp.watch(paths.sass, ['sass']);
    gulp.watch(paths.css, ['css']);
    gulp.watch(paths.js, ['js']);
    gulp.watch(paths.lib, ['lib']);
    gulp.watch(paths.images, ['images']);
    gulp.watch(paths.templates, ['templates']);
});
```

# JS

The task which compiles the application javascript from*/app/js* is **js**
```javascript
gulp.task('js', ['envConfig'], function(done) {
    var stream = gulp.src(paths.js)
        //.pipe(print())
        .pipe(plumber({ errorHandler: onError }))
        .pipe(sourcemaps.init({loadMaps: true}));
    if(env == 'prod')
        stream.pipe(removeCode({ production: true }))

    stream
        //.pipe(babel())
        .pipe(ngAnnotate())
        .pipe(angularFilesort())
        .pipe(concat('app.js'))
        .pipe(uglify({compress:{
            //pure_funcs: [ 'console.log' ]
        }}))
        .pipe(rename({ extname: '.min.js' }))
        .pipe(sourcemaps.write('/maps'))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./www/'))
        .on('end', done);
});
```

By default the uglify task is used, which compresses and renames the javascript sources (so the variables names will change to a, b etc)
This is done to:
Improve performance
Increase difficulty of reverse engineering

The mangling of the source code makes it difficult to debug, however sourcemaps come to the rescue here, as they provide the reverse mapping.
Chrome and other tools have support for sourcemaps, so when debugging in chrome it will show you the original line numbers and methd names.


It's a good idea to use the uglify task by default when developing so the production code is the same as test to catch any bugs in the uglification.
However when you have a tricky issue you are trying to debug on a phone then you may want to temporarily disable it to easily see the stack traces.

The babel() task provides support for the Bable transpiler, which allows you to use ECMAScript 6 functionality.

## Bower generated paths

In a number of the tasks the source path starts with
```
bowerFiles(bowerConf)
```

This goes through the dependencies defined in **/bower.json**. For each dependancy it looks at it's bower.json file (for example /bower_components/ionic/bower.json)
and adds the array of files/paths from the *main* property

Normally you can just add a new package dependancy to **/bower.json**. However make sure you double check the files/path it exports from the main property its own bower.json file.

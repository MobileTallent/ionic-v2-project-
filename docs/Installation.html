# Setup

The instructions below will get your own custom version of Cloneder setup for development.

If you have any issues with building or running the app then:

* Make sure you have completed **ALL** the steps. A number of support requests have been due to not uploading the Cloud code or not setting the Facebook app ids

* First check the [Troubleshooting.html](Troubleshooting.html) page.

* Secondly, search Google or StackOverflow with the error you are getting, as you can often find a solution very quickly.

* Finally you may contacting support. Please provide the full logs from the command line and/or browser as appropriate.

There are additional instructions on the [Publishing_to_app_store.html](Publishing_to_app_store.html) page for when you are ready to do a production release.

There are many steps and many components required to build the app for all three platforms, web, Android and iOS.
Please read through **ALL** the documentation provided. Once you've done the initial setup its a good idea to read through it
all again, as when you're more familiar with the setup then more tips and steps in the documentation will make more sense.

**All the bullet points in the following instructions are actions to be completed**, with additional information before/after the point.

# Code Repository

The Cloneder source code is currently provided as a Git repository on BitBucket.org.

* Create your own fork of the code repository in BitBucket.

You may need to click the ... button at the top of the left menu to see the Fork action. More info on forking at https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Forking+a+Repository

To download your fork you will want a Git GUI application such as [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)

* Clone your repository to your computer using the Git command line or a Git GUI

Once you have cloned the project open up a command prompt in the project root folder.

* Run: **git branch dev**

This makes a new branch within your fork of the repository, and you will do your customisations in the dev branch and not the master branch.
It's essential to do this so you can easily merge in new updates from the base Cloneder code.



# Node.js setup

The Cloneder app is primarily developed in JavaScript and TypeScript.  The build tools also uses the node.js ecosystem.

* Install node.js from http://nodejs.org/

* Make sure you have the pre-requisite installations for node-gyp (See https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp)

* Change to /server and run: **npm run installglobals**

If on OSX/linux you shouldn't be logged in as an admin/root user, so you will need to run it with **sudo**.

* Change directory to /app run **npm install**



You may need to run **npm install** twice as sometimes it doesn't install everything the first time.

The install scripts will perform extra tasks such as installing the webdriver for the integration test tools.


## JavaScript Development tools

There are a number of IDE's you can use. We personally use WebStorm by JetBrains (https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). The Ionic team have said they are quite happy using
the new Microsoft Visual Studio. Another lightweight option is the editor Sublime.

* Install WebStorm, Visual Studio or Sublime

### WebStorm setup

We setup two different IDE projects, one for the server folder and another for the app folder.

First for the mobile app project:

* File -> New Project From Existing Files...
* Select Source files are in a local directory, no Web server is yet configured
* Select the /app folder and select the Project Root button
* Expand the project folder, highlight the npm_modules, bower_components, platforms, plugin-source and plugins directories, then right click and select the Excluded folder button

The platforms folder will not exist yet, you can exclude it later by right clicking then Mark Directory As -> Excluded

Excluding these folders speeds up WebStorm as it does not try to index the files in these folders, and avoids having duplicate
suggestions in the auto-completion.

Once the project is open, go to

* Preferences... -> Languages and Frameworks -> JavaScript
* Set JavaScript Language Version to ECMAScript 6

Now create a project for the server code:

* File -> New Project From Existing Files...
* Select Source files are in a local directory, no Web server is yet configured
* Select the /server folder and select the Project Root button
* Expand the project folder, highlight the npm_modules then right click and select the Excluded folder button


# Server setup

Cloneder is developed using the Parse framework. Previously Parse was a fully managed service but now that
they are shutting down they have release an API compatible node.js server which is at
[https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server)

* Install MongoDB

In development you will need to start the Mongo database yourself. If you want to specify where it put the data the command is in the form
**mongod --dbpath /path/to/the/mongo-data/**

* Change directory to /server folder and run **npm install**

* In /server/parse-config.js enter a appId and masterKey (random numbers and letters, about 16 characters is good)
(You can create as many configurations as you need, QA, integration etc.) You probably wont have a production
database URI just yet.

* Add the appId to the dev.json, qa.json and prod.json files in /app/app/config/

Note that Cloneder uses both the Javascript and Android/iOS (Client) SDK's.  The native/client plugin is required for
the push notifications. The Javascript SDK/API is used for everything else (authentication, data).

The server-side code is also referred to as Cloud Code

* Read the [Cloud code guide](https://www.parse.com/docs/cloud_code_guide)

(Note that this guide is for the old managed service, there are some differences with open-source Parse API server)


### Twilio video chat (optional)

Twilio is used for the real-time video chat (and in the future will be used for SMS notifications).

* Create an account at http://www.twilio.com and upgrade to a paid account.

* Create a set of API keys (Dev Tools -> API Keys)

* Create a video profile (Programmable Video -> Configuration Profiles)

* Enter these Twilio configuration values in /server/config.json

account_sid is your Twilio account id
api_key is from https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video/dev-tools/api-keys
configuration_sid is from https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video/profiles


### LinkedIn (optional)

If you want to enable the optional LinkedIn authentication then:

* Create an app(s) at https://www.linkedin.com/developer/apps

* In the app settings check r_basicprofile and r_emailaddress

* Add http://localhost/callback to the OAuth2 callbacks

* Copy the Client Id and Client Secret to the linkedInId and linkedInSecret values in /app/app/common.json


# Mobile app initial setup

### Install Android SDK

* Install Android studio or the SDK tools from http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html

You will need to generate a keystore to sign your release builds with.

* Follow the instructions at at http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html to generate the keystore

### Base configuration

Choose a package name for your project. It should follow the Java package naming conventions,
which is your domain name in reverse and then the project name.

For example we have used com.engineerstoolbox.cloneder

* Open **/app/config.xml** and update the widget id attribute with your package name.

* Update all the other appropriate values in **/app/config.xml** (email, description, app name etc)

* Change directory to /app folder and run **npm install**

The npm post install script will add the ios and android platforms. If you are on a Windows computer then the ios
platform will fail, so you may wish to remove from /app/package.json the ios entry in cordovaPlatforms.

**DO NOT** check in the files under /app/platforms into Git. You should be able to remove and re-add the platforms at any time.
The scripts in the /app/hooks directory perform any custom actions required on the platform files.

**DO NOT** try to build the Android project from the build scripts in the /platform/android/ directory.
You must use the **cordova** or **ionic** build commands from the project root folder which are covered later.
You should not normally need to open the Android project /platform/android in Eclipse/ADT etc.

## iOS

iOS builds and app submissions can only be done on a Mac with OSX and XCode.

Ionic does have an iOS build service at http://docs.ionic.io/docs/package-ios but as we use our own Mac's to build we can't comment on using it

* Run ** npm install -g ios-sim** to install the iOS emulator plugin

Follow the instructions to setup push notifications for iOS. This is complicated and you can delay doing this step until you are ready for a production build.
https://parse.com/tutorials/ios-push-notifications

Unlike the Android platform, you will need to open /platforms/ios/(project name).xcodeproj with XCode to perform the release builds.

# Facebook

Cloneder requires a Facebook app to provide authentication and details from the users Facebook accounts.

* Go to https://developers.facebook.com/ and create a new app.

### Facebook Web setup

* In the app Settings add the Website platform.

* Set the Site URL to http://localhost:8100/

This will allow the oAuth callback from Facebook when developing in the browser.

### Facebook Android setup

Start with Android

Enter your app name

Fill in the section 'Tell us about your Android project"
Package name: Use the one you decided in the previous *App initial setup* section above
Default Activity Class Name (add .CordovaAppp to the package name)
com.engineerstoolbox.cloneder.CordovaApp

To get the release key hash you have two options.
Run (replacing YOUR_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS and YOUR_RELEASE_KEY_PATH with the appropriate values):
keytool -exportcert -alias YOUR_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS -keystore YOUR_RELEASE_KEY_PATH | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64
(You will have need to completed the android setup and release steps to have this. You can do it later)

or othewise just try and login to Facebook. You will get an error something like "The hash aurhgu3u4gh9a3u4hg= is not found"
Then type that hash into the Facebook Android hash configuration.

The official Facebook Android setup docs are at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started


### Facebook App settings

It may be advisable to increase the age restriction to 18+

* Status & Review tab.  Set status to Live/YES

### Facebook configuration setup

* Open **/app/package.json** and look for the line "com.phonegap.plugins.facebookconnect --variable APP_ID=\"\" --variable APP_NAME=\"\""

* Update the APP_ID and APP_NAME values with that of your Facebook app (e.g. --variable APP_ID=\"123456789\" --variable APP_NAME=\"My App\"" )

* Update /server/parse-[prod|dev].json with your facebook id for the **oauth.facebook.appIds** value

Before adding a cordova platform, you will need to delete the */plugins/com.phonegap.plugins.facebookconnect* folder.
This way the script will add it with the APP_ID and APP_NAME variables from */plugin-source/com.phonegap.plugins.facebookconnect*

(Note that now the gulp build script envConfig task will update the APP_ID and APP_NAME per build environment i.e. dev/qa/prod at build time)

The other reason we install the facebook plugin from a local clone is because there is an issue with the symbolic links breaking for the iOS platform when cloning it from Github

At some point you will need to submit your Facebook application for review so the app use the extended permissions to get the birthdate, likes and photos from the users facebook account.
Note: You will need to remove the website platform when you submit your application for review to enable the extended permissions
The estimated review time is 7 days an in that time you can't re-add the website platform.
What you can do is make another facebook app with the website platform and update the var FACEBOOK_APP_ID in /app/js/app.js
Parse doesn't care which Facebook app you are using.


### Google Map key

* Get your public API key and add it to the script tag which loads the google maps in **/www/index.html**
```
<script src="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=[Your API key here]"></script>
```
See https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key for creating your key

### AdMob (optional)

AdMob is the Google mobile advertising product. If you want banner and/or then do the following:

* Create and account at https://www.google.com/admob/

* Enter the appropriate ids in /app/app/config/common.js in the **adMob** section.

* If you enable ads in Android then in the Google Play Store developer console for your app select the option at
**Pricing & Distribution** > **CONTAINS ADS** >  *Does your application have ads?*

If you enter the ids for a platform then the default code in Cloneder is to display a banner ad which is configured in /app/js/app.js

See https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-admob-pro for more details on configuring ads

### Icons

* Read http://ionicframework.com/blog/automating-icons-and-splash-screens/ for creating and setting up your slash screen and icon images

# Running the app in Chrome/Safari

**DO NOT** use the **ionic serve** command which you would know if you are familiar with Ionic. The provided gulp file in
this project is more advanced and provides production grade features.

* From the /app folder run: **gulp**

This will start a continuous build process which does not exit, and watches for changes to the files to rebuild.

You should see some console output like this when the initial build is complete:
```
[09:22:05] Finished 'templates' after 5.02 s
[09:22:07] Finished 'js' after 6.33 s
app/js/controller-profile.ts(97,17): 2339 Property 'findLastIndex' does not exist on type 'UnderscoreStatic'.
app/js/controller-profile.ts(149,24): 2304 Cannot find name 'CameraPopoverOptions'.
app/js/controller-profile.ts(156,24): 2339 Property 'cropPhoto' does not exist on type 'IAppRootScope'.
[09:22:09] Finished 'compile-ts' after 9.78 s
[09:22:35] Finished 'lib-css' after 35 s
[09:22:35] Finished 'lib' after 35 s
[09:22:35] Starting 'default'...
[09:22:35] Finished 'default' after 5.51 μs
```
Ignore the 3 TypeScript warnings.

* Open up http://localhost:8100 in Chrome or Safari.

If everything is configured ok you should see the running app.

Any changes to the files under app and bower_components will be compiled, joined together and compressed, then copied to the www folder
(the output files are app.js, app.ts.js, app.css, templates.js, lib.js, lib.css)

As you make JS, CSS and HTML changes you should only need to refresh the browser to get the changes.

The gulp build supports dev, qa and productions build with different configuration parameters. See the *envConfig* task
in the gulf file and the files in /app/app/config/. To do a production configured build run:
**gulp --env prod**

# Build/Run with Emulators or Real Devices

### Android

If you don't have an Android device and are using the emulator then don't use the default emulator which is very slow,
instead use Genymotion

* Run: **ionic run android**

If an Android device is connected it will deploy the .apk to the device and launch the app. Otherwise it will open it with the emulator.

### iOS

If you have installed ios-sim then

* Run: **ionic run ios**

To run the emulator. The console log will end with the file path to the logs from the emulator.  Similar to the path below (with username replace to what your Mac username is)

* Run: ** tail -r /Users/username/appname/platforms/ios/cordova/console.log**

to view the logs while you are using the emulator.

To deploy a debug build to your real iOS device you will need to do it from XCode.

The iOS emulator is sufficient for most purposes. The main limitation is it can't receive push notifications.

# Dashboard

The admin dashboard is a separate Parse project

* Follow the instruction at https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-dashboard to setup and run the dashboard

# Merging updates

After creating your fork of Cloneder, there will be updates to Cloneder to merge into your code.

In BitBucket you will see a notification if there are new updates in the Cloneder to sync into your fork. You should
regularly sync the cloneder code.

As you merge the changes in be sure to read the commit messages for each changeset as there may be notes on what you
need to do to your app or development environment to be compatible with the update. Look for MERGE NOTES in the changeset
comments. Also briefly look through the changes in the files.



# Google Cloud Platform account setup

A Google Cloud account is required for push notifications.


Create your Google Cloud account and go to the projects page at https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects

Click Create Project

Expand the advanced options and select the location that is closest to your main user base. If unsure, or expecting
global users then leave as the default option.  If you are migrating a live Parse app then choose usa-east1 as that
will be the closest to the Parse AWS datacenter.

https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=

Go the IAM & Admin Settings page and copy your project number. Open up the file /server/parse-config.js and enter the project
number in the parseConfig object for pushConfig.android.senderId

Go to API Manager -> Credentials and create a new service account key in json format.

Download the file then save it as /service-account-key.json


Enable Google Play Android Developer API

Go to the Google Play Developer Console, then go to Settings -> API access and link your production project
and the grant access to the service account you created in the previous step


TODO https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Parse-Server/wiki/Push-Configuring-Clients#configure-broadcast-receiver-and-permissions

## Google Cloud Platform server setup

We run our Cloneder projects with server on the Google Cloud Platform. The following instructions are if you
intend to run the database and servers on the Google Cloud Platform using the Google App Engine.

For other hosting options follow the documentation on the [Parse wiki](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki)

* Install the Google Cloud SDK https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/

* Install the beta command for the gcloud Google Cloud SDK

* run: gcloud auth login

* Next go to the Google Cloud console at https://console.cloud.google.com

* Create a billing account (which you will need to enable billing for your projects) https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499?hl=en

* Create a project for each environment you want in the cloud (QA, production etc) with billing enabled

* In /server/package.json update the QA_PROJECT_ID and PROD_PROJECT_ID in the scripts deploy-qa and deploy-prod entries

* In /server/parse-config.json replace the <QA_PROJECT_ID> and <PROD_PROJECT_ID> placeholders with your project ids

## Database setup

### Mongo QA/production databases

#### Option 1 - Managed database

MLab provides fully managed Mongo databases at https://mlab.com.
Make sure you select the same region as the App Engine region in your project

#### Option 2 - Self-managed

Go to the Cloud Launcher

MongoDB (Google Click to Deploy)
https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/config/click-to-deploy-images/mongodb?src=console&project=my-cloneder-app

* Make sure the zone is in your projects App Engine region

For a cheapest setup option (for QA or low traffic prod apps)
    Select
    Node count: 1
    Machine type: f1-micro
    Data Disk Type: SSD
    Disk Size in GB: 10GB
    Arbiter count: 0

Open Compute Engine -> VM Instances
Copy the internal IP for your mongo database
Open /server/parse-config.js and update the <QA_DB> or <PROD_DB> with the IP address


Go to versions and stop the old version

For detailed information on the node.js runtime environment on Google App Engine see https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/nodejs/runtime

    Select API Manager from the side menu
    Enable the
    Compute Engine API
    Cloud Storage Service
    Google Maps JavaScript API
    Google Cloud Messaging
    Cloud Monitoring API

# Setup

The instructions below will get your own custom version of Cloneder setup for development.

If you have any issues with building or running the app then:

* Make sure you have completed **ALL** the steps. A number of support requests have been due to not uploading the Cloud code or not setting the Facebook app ids

* First check the [Troubleshooting.html](Troubleshooting.html) page.

* Secondly, search Google or StackOverflow with the error you are getting, as you can often find a solution very quickly.

* Finally you may contacting support. Please provide the full logs from the command line and/or browser as appropriate.

There are additional instructions on the [Publishing_to_app_store.html](Publishing_to_app_store.html) page for when you are ready to do a production release.

There are many steps and many components required to build the app for all three platforms, web, Android and iOS.
Please read through **ALL** the documentation provided. Once you've done the initial setup its a good idea to read through it
all again, as when you're more familiar with the setup then more tips and steps in the documentation will make more sense.

**All the bullet points in the following instructions are actions to be completed**, with additional information before/after the point.

# Code Repository

The Cloneder source code is currently provided as a Git repository on BitBucket.org.

* Create your own fork of the code repository in BitBucket.

You may need to click the ... button at the top of the left menu to see the Fork action. More info on forking at https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Forking+a+Repository

To download your fork you will want a Git GUI application such as [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)

* Clone your repository to your computer using the Git command line or a Git GUI

Once you have cloned the project open up a command prompt in the project root folder.

* Run: **git branch dev**

This makes a new branch within your fork of the repository, and you will do your customisations in the dev branch and not the master branch.
It's essential to do this so you can easily merge in new updates from the base Cloneder code.



# Node.js setup

The Cloneder app is primarily developed in JavaScript and TypeScript.  The build tools also uses the node.js ecosystem.

* Install node.js from http://nodejs.org/

* Make sure you have the pre-requisite installations for node-gyp (See https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp#installation)
particularly for Windows users (The Visual C++ build tools, Python 2.7 and set msvs_version steps).

* Change to /server and run: **npm run installglobals**

If on OSX/linux you shouldn't be logged in as an admin/root user, so you will need to run it with **sudo**. In Windows you may need to run it as Administrator.

If you get an error installing on Windows then to fix this delete the folder C:\Users\<username>\.node-gyp\<node_version>\include\node\openssl and retry npm install

## JavaScript Development tools

There are a number of IDE's you can use. We personally use WebStorm by JetBrains (https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). The Ionic team have said they are quite happy using
the new Microsoft Visual Studio. Another lightweight option is the editor Sublime.

* Install WebStorm, Visual Studio or Sublime

### WebStorm setup

We setup two different IDE projects, one for the server folder and another for the app folder.

First for the mobile app project:

* File -> New Project From Existing Files...
* Select Source files are in a local directory, no Web server is yet configured
* Select the /app folder and select the Project Root button
* Expand the project folder, highlight the npm_modules, bower_components, platforms, plugin-source and plugins directories, then right click and select the Excluded folder button

The platforms folder will not exist yet, you can exclude it later by right clicking then Mark Directory As -> Excluded

Excluding these folders speeds up WebStorm as it does not try to index the files in these folders, and avoids having duplicate
suggestions in the auto-completion.

Once the project is open, go to

* Preferences... -> Languages and Frameworks -> JavaScript
* Set JavaScript Language Version to ECMAScript 6

Now create a project for the server code:

* File -> New Project From Existing Files...
* Select Source files are in a local directory, no Web server is yet configured
* Select the /server folder and select the Project Root button
* Expand the project folder, highlight the npm_modules then right click and select the Excluded folder button


# Server setup (Local development)

Cloneder is developed using the Parse framework. Previously Parse was a fully managed service but now that
they are shutting down they have release an API compatible node.js server which is at
[https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server)

* Install MongoDB

In development you will need to start the Mongo database yourself. If you want to specify where it put the data the command is in the form
**mongod --dbpath /path/to/the/mongo-data/**

* Change directory to /server folder and run **npm install**

* In /server/config.json enter your appName,

* In /server/config.json enter an appId and masterKey (random numbers and letters, about 16 characters is good)



# Mobile app initial setup

### Install Android SDK

* Install Android studio or the SDK tools from http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html

See the Ionic tips on setting up the Android SDK at http://ionicframework.com/docs/ionic-cli-faq/#android-sdk

If you have an existing SDK installation open the SDK Manager and in the Extras section make sure the following are up to date:

Local Maven repository for Support Libraries<br/>
Android Support Library<br/>
Android Support Repository<br/>


* Follow the instructions at at http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html to generate the keystore

* Save the keystore file to /app/android.keystore

* Update the /app/buid.json file with the keystore alias and put the password in both fields.


### Base configuration

Choose a package name for your project. It should follow the Java package naming conventions,
which is your domain name in reverse and then the project name.

For example we have used com.engineerstoolbox.cloneder

* Open **/app/config.xml** and update the widget id attribute with your package name.

* Update all the other appropriate values in **/app/config.xml** (email, description, app name etc)

* Change directory to /app folder and run **npm install**

* In /app run **ionic platform add android**

**DO NOT** check in the files under /app/platforms into Git. You should be able to remove and re-add the platforms at any time.
The scripts in the /app/hooks directory perform any custom actions required on the platform files. The .gitignore file
is setup to ignore the files under /platforms/android|ios by default.

**DO NOT** try to build the Android project from the build scripts in the /platform/android/ directory.
You must use the **cordova** or **ionic** build commands from the /app folder which are covered later.
You should not normally need to open the Android project /platform/android in Eclipse/ADT etc.

## iOS

iOS builds and app submissions can only be done on a Mac with OSX and XCode.

Ionic does have an iOS build service at http://docs.ionic.io/docs/package-ios but as we use our own Mac's to build we can't comment on using it.

* Install the Rugy gems package manager at https://rubygems.org/pages/download

* Run ** npm run ios-setup** to install the iOS emulator plugin, ios-deploy module, and the Fastland deploy tools.

This can take a while to complete and some user input will be required. When the deliver tool asks for your bundle id you
can enter the package name used in the Android config from the previous step. Use this bundle id when you create your Apple store listing.

If you are having any issues look in /app/package.json at the scripts.ios-setup value and run the commands individually

* In /app/package.json edit the scripts.deploy-ios and scripts.deploy-ios-test value by updating **AppName.ipa** to replace AppName with your app name defined in /app.config.xml

* In /app run **ionic platform add ios**

Follow the instructions to setup push notifications for iOS. This is complicated and you can delay doing this step until you are ready for a production build.
https://parse.com/tutorials/ios-push-notifications

Unlike the Android platform, you will need to open /platforms/ios/(project name).xcodeproj with XCode to perform the release builds.

# Facebook

Cloneder requires a Facebook app to provide authentication and details from the users Facebook accounts.

* Go to https://developers.facebook.com/ and create a new app.

### Facebook Web setup

* In the app Settings add the Website platform.

* Set the Site URL to http://localhost:8100/

This will allow the oAuth callback from Facebook when developing in the browser.

### Facebook Android setup

Start with Android

Enter your app name

Fill in the section 'Tell us about your Android project"<br/>
Package name: Use the one you decided in the previous *App initial setup* section above.<br/>
Default Activity Class Name (add .CordovaAppp to the package name, for example com.engineerstoolbox.cloneder.CordovaApp)

To get the release key hash you have two options.
Run (replacing YOUR_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS and YOUR_RELEASE_KEY_PATH with the appropriate values):
keytool -exportcert -alias YOUR_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS -keystore YOUR_RELEASE_KEY_PATH | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64
(You will have need to completed the android setup and release steps to have this. You can do it later)

or otherwise just try and login to Facebook. You will get an error like "The hash aurhgu3u4gh9a3u4hg= is not found"
Then type that hash into the Facebook Android hash configuration.

### Facebook App settings

It may be advisable to increase the age restriction to 18+

* Status & Review tab.  Set status to Live/YES

### Facebook configuration setup

* In /server/config.json update the facebookAppId and facebookAppName with your Facebook app id and name.

* In the /app folder run: **npm run addFacebookPlugin**

At some point you will need to submit your Facebook application for review so the app use the extended permissions to get the birthdate, likes and photos from the users facebook account.
Note: You will need to remove the website platform when you submit your application for review to enable the extended permissions
The estimated review time is 7 days an in that time you can't re-add the website platform.
What you can do is make another facebook app with the website platform and update the var FACEBOOK_APP_ID in /app/js/app.js
Parse doesn't care which Facebook app you are using.

### Install Parse Push plugin

* In the /app folder run: **npm run addParsePlugin**

This requires the prod.gcpProjectNumber value to have been set in /server/config.json

# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account setup

A Google Cloud account is required as a minimum for push notifications and maps.

* Create your Google Cloud account and go to the projects page at https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects

* Click Create Project and name it in the format appname-prod (for example we named ours cloneder-prod)

The project naming convention is used in the configuration is appName-environment, e.g. appName-prod, appName-qa

If you will be hosting your production server on the GCP then open the advanced options and select the location that is closest to your main user base.
If unsure, or expecting global users then leave as the default option.  If you are migrating a live Parse app then choose usa-east1 as that
will be the closest to the Parse AWS datacenter.

* Go to the IAM & Admin -> Settings page. In /server/config.json copy the Project ID and Project number to the values for prod.gcpProjectId and prod.gcpProjectNumber

* Go to API Manager -> Credentials and create a new service account key in json format.

* Download the file then save it as /server/service-account-key-prod.json

* In API Manager -> Credentials chose Create credentials -> Browser key and enter the value in /server/config.json for gcpBrowserKey

* In API Manager -> Credentials chose Create credentials -> Server key and enter the value in /server/config.json for gcpServerKey

* In API Manager -> Overview go to Google Maps JavaScript API and enable the API



#### Enable Google Play Android Developer API

* Go to the [Google Play Developer Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) and create your initial app listing.

* In the Play console go to Settings -> API access and link your production project and the grant access to the service account you created in the previous step.

TODO https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Parse-Server/wiki/Push-Configuring-Clients#configure-broadcast-receiver-and-permissions


### Twilio video chat (optional)

Twilio is used for the real-time video chat (and in the future will be used for SMS notifications).

* Create an account at http://www.twilio.com and upgrade to a paid account.

* Create a set of API keys (Dev Tools -> API Keys)

* Create a video profile (Programmable Video -> Configuration Profiles)

* Enter these Twilio configuration values in /server/config.json

account_sid is your Twilio account id
api_key is from https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video/dev-tools/api-keys
configuration_sid is from https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video/profiles


### LinkedIn (optional)

If you want to enable the optional LinkedIn authentication then:

* Create an app(s) at https://www.linkedin.com/developer/apps

* In the app settings check r_basicprofile and r_emailaddress

* Add http://localhost/callback to the OAuth2 callbacks

* Copy the Client Id and Client Secret to the linkedInId and linkedInSecret values in /server/config.json

### AdMob (optional)

AdMob is the Google mobile advertising product. If you want banner and/or then do the following:

* Create and account at https://www.google.com/admob/

* Enter the appropriate ids in /server/config.json in the **adMob** section.

* If you enable ads in Android then in the Google Play Store developer console for your app select the option at
**Pricing & Distribution** > **CONTAINS ADS** >  *Does your application have ads?*

If you enter the ids for a platform then the default code is to display a banner ad which is configured in /app/js/app.js

See https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-admob-pro for more details on configuring ads

For the Android build you will need some extras installed in the Android SDK Manager otherwise you will get build errors.

### Icons

* Read http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/icon-splashscreen.html for creating and setting up your slash screen and icon images.

More info on icon/splash resources at http://ionicframework.com/blog/automating-icons-and-splash-screens/


# Development - Running the app in Chrome/Safari

Start the node.js Parse server. From the /server folder run **npm start**

**DO NOT** use the **ionic serve** command which you would know if you are familiar with Ionic. The provided gulp file in
this project is more advanced and provides production grade features.

* From the /app folder run: **gulp**

This will start a continuous build process which does not exit, and watches for changes to the files to rebuild.

You should see some console output like this when the initial build is complete:
```
[09:22:05] Finished 'templates' after 5.02 s
[09:22:07] Finished 'js' after 6.33 s
app/js/controller-profile.ts(97,17): 2339 Property 'findLastIndex' does not exist on type 'UnderscoreStatic'.
app/js/controller-profile.ts(149,24): 2304 Cannot find name 'CameraPopoverOptions'.
app/js/controller-profile.ts(156,24): 2339 Property 'cropPhoto' does not exist on type 'IAppRootScope'.
[09:22:09] Finished 'compile-ts' after 9.78 s
[09:22:35] Finished 'lib-css' after 35 s
[09:22:35] Finished 'lib' after 35 s
[09:22:35] Starting 'default'...
[09:22:35] Finished 'default' after 5.51 μs
```
Ignore the 3 TypeScript warnings.

* Open up [http://localhost:8100](http://localhost:8100) in Chrome.

If everything is configured ok you should see the running app.

Any changes to the files under app and bower_components will be compiled, joined together and compressed, then copied to the www folder
(the output files are app.js, app.ts.js, app.css, templates.js, lib.js, lib.css)

As you make JS, CSS and HTML changes you should only need to refresh the browser to get the changes.

The gulp build supports dev, qa and productions build with different configuration parameters. See the *envConfig* task
in the gulp file and the main config file /server/config.json. To do a production configured build run:
**gulp --env prod**

# Build/Run with Emulators or Real Devices

Its possible to test on a device with the local development server. You will need to find the IP address of your
computer that the phone will be able to find through USB or your local network, then update the dev.parseServerUrl value
in /server/config.json and restart gulp.  Otherwise deploy the sever app to the cloud and use a qa environment.
Instructions for Google App Engine, which we recommend, are further below.


**NOTE:** We have noticed when adding the android platform not all the plugins are installed/configured,
(in particular ionic-plugin-keyboard, cordova-plugin-file, cordova-plugin-device and the parse push plugin)
hence in the initial install script the **ionic state restore --plugins** command is run.
If you are re-adding a platform you may need to run this manually.

### Android

If you don't have an Android device and are using the emulator then don't use the default emulator which is very slow,
instead use [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/)

* Run: **ionic run android**

If an Android device is connected it will deploy the .apk to the device and launch the app. Otherwise it will open it with the emulator.

### iOS

If you have installed ios-sim then

* Run: **ionic run ios**

To run the emulator. The console log will end with the file path to the logs from the emulator.  Similar to the path below (with username replace to what your Mac username is)

* Run: ** tail -r /Users/username/appname/platforms/ios/cordova/console.log**

to view the logs while you are using the emulator.

To deploy a debug build to your real iOS device you will need to do it from XCode.

The iOS emulator is sufficient for most purposes. The main limitation is it can't receive push notifications.

# Dashboard

The admin dashboard is a separate Parse project at https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-dashboard

The parse-dashboard should already be installed from the previous server setup step (npm run installglobals)

Npm scripts in /server/package.json are provided to automatically start the dashboard with the correct parameters.

In /server run **npm run dashboard-dev** or **npm run dashboard-qa** or **npm run dashboard-prod**

# Merging updates

After creating your fork of Cloneder, there will be updates to Cloneder to merge into your code.

In BitBucket you will see a notification if there are new updates in the Cloneder to sync into your fork. You should
regularly sync the cloneder code.

As you merge the changes in be sure to read the commit messages for each changeset as there may be notes on what you
need to do to your app or development environment to be compatible with the update. Look for MERGE NOTES in the changeset
comments. Also briefly look through the changes in the files.





# Google Cloud Platform QA/Production server setup

We run our Cloneder projects on the Google Cloud Platform. The following instructions are if you
intend to run the database and servers on the Google Cloud Platform using the Google App Engine.

For other hosting options follow the documentation on the [Parse wiki](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki)

* Install the Google Cloud SDK https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/

* Install the beta command for the gcloud Google Cloud SDK

* run: gcloud auth login

* Next go to the Google Cloud console at https://console.cloud.google.com

* Create a billing account (which you will need to enable billing for your projects) https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499?hl=en

* Create a project for each environment you want in the cloud (QA, production etc) with billing enabled (e.g appname-prod, appname-qa). You should have already created the production project in the previous step.

* In /server/config.json update the GCP configuration values in the qa and prod sections.  You can leave the parseServerUrl blank, it will be automatically configured when running in Google App Engine.

## Database setup

### Mongo QA/production databases

#### Option 1 - Managed database

MLab provides fully managed Mongo databases at https://mlab.com.

**Make sure you select the same region as the App Engine region in your project**

* Create the Mongo database with the appropriate specifications

* In /server/config.json update the qa.databaseURI and/or prod.databaseURI with the IP address of the Mongo database

#### Option 2 - Self-managed

* Go to the Google Cloud Launcher (https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher?project=PROJECT-NAME)

* Search for the **MongoDB (Google Click to Deploy)** option

* Make sure the zone is in your projects App Engine region

For a cheapest setup option (for QA or low traffic prod apps)
    Select
    Node count: 1
    Machine type: f1-micro
    Data Disk Type: SSD
    Disk Size in GB: 10GB
    Arbiter count: 0

* Open Compute Engine -> VM Instances and copy the internal IP for your Mongo database

* In /server/config.json update the qa.databaseURI and/or prod.databaseURI with the IP address of the Mongo database

For detailed information on the node.js runtime environment on Google App Engine see https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/nodejs/runtime

To deploy the server app go to /serve and run **npm run deploy-prod**

There is also **npm run deploy-qa** command configured in the /server/package.json

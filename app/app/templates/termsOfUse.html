            <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These
                Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. You warrant that you are at
                least 18-years-old and you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts. If you are under 18-years-old,
                you warrant that you have obtained consent from your parent or guardian and they agree to be bound by these
                Terms on your behalf.</p>
            <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the
                terms then you may not access the Service.</p>
            <p><strong>Accounts</strong></p>
            <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at
                all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination
                of your account on our Service.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or
                actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.</p>
            <p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You agree to be fully responsible for activities
                that relate to your account or your password. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach
                of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
            <p><strong>Links To Other Web Sites</strong></p>
            <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Just a
                Baby.
            </p>
            <p>Just a Baby has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices
                of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that Just a Baby shall not be
                responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or
                in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any
                such web sites or services.
            </p>
            <p>We only provide links to external websites as a convenience, and the inclusion of such a link to external websites
                do not imply our endorsement of those websites. You acknowledge and agree that when you access other websites
                on the Internet, you do so at your own risk.</p>
            <p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or
                services that you visit.</p>
            <p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever,
                including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
            <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account,
                you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>
            <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including,
                without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
            <p>We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any claims or damages arising out of any termination or
                suspension or any other actions taken by us in connection therewith.</p>
            <p>If applicable law requires us to provide notice of termination or cancellation, we may give prior or subsequent
                notice by posting it on the Service or by sending a communication to any address (email or otherwise) that
                we have for you in our records.</p>
            <p><strong>Governing Law</strong></p>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of New South Wales, Australia, without
                regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.
                If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions
                of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our
                Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>
            <p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is
                material we will try to provide at least 15 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect.</p>
            <p>It is your sole responsibility to periodically check these Terms for any changes. If you do not agree with any
                of the changes to these Terms, it is your sole responsibility to stop using the Service. Your continued use
                of the Service will be deemed as your acceptance thereof.</p>

Phonegap Parse.com Plugin
=========================

Phonegap 3.x plugin for Parse.com push service.

[Parse.com's](http://parse.com) Javascript API has no mechanism to register a device for or receive push notifications, which
makes it fairly useless for PN in Phonegap/Cordova. This plugin bridges the gap by leveraging native Parse.com SDKs
to register/receive PNs and allow a few essential methods to be accessible from Javascript. 

_Please note that I've only worked on the Android aspect of this fork. The iOS side is not yet up to date._

For Android, Parse SDK v1.8.1 is used. This means GCM support and no more background process `PushService` unnecessarily
taps device battery to duplicate what GCM already provides.

This plugin exposes the four native Android API push services to JS:
* **register**( options, successCB, errorCB )   -- register the device to receive PN
* **getInstallationId**( successCB, errorCB )
* **getSubscriptions**( successCB, errorCB )
* **subscribe**( channel, successCB, errorCB )
* **unsubscribe**( channel, successCB, errorCB )

Installation
------------

Pick one of these two commands:

```
phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/1985media/parse-push-plugin
cordova plugin add https://github.com/1985media/parse-push-plugin
```

####Android devices without Google Cloud Messaging:
If you only care about GCM devices, you're good to go. Move on to the [Usage](#usage) section. 

The automatic setup above does not work for non-GCM devices. To support them, the `ParseBroadcastReceiver`
must be setup to work properly. My guess is this receiver takes care of establishing a persistent connection that will
handle push notifications without GCM. Follow these steps for `ParseBroadcastReceiver` setup:

1. Add the following to your AndroidManifest.xml, inside the `<application>` tag
    ```xml
    <receiver android:name="com.parse.ParseBroadcastReceiver">
       <intent-filter>
          <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" />
          <action android:name="android.intent.action.USER_PRESENT" />
       </intent-filter>
    </receiver>
    ```
    
2. Add the following permission to AndroidManifest.xml, as a sibling of the `<application>` tag
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" />
    ```
On the surface, step 1 & 2 should be enough. However, when one of the actions `BOOT_COMPLETED` or
`USER_PRESENT` (on screen unlock) occurs, `ParseBroadastReceiver` gets invoked well before your Javascript
code or this plugin's Java code gets a chance to call `Parse.initialize()`. The Parse SDK then barfs, causing
your app to crash. Continue with steps 3 & 4 to fix this.

3. Phonegap/Cordova doesn't seem to define its own android.app.Application, it only defines an android Activity.
We'll need to define an application class to override the default `onCreate` behavior and call `Parse.initialize()`
so the crash described above does not occur. In your application's Java source path, e.g., `platforms/android/src/com/example/app`, create a file
named MainApplication.java and define it this way
    ```java
    package com.example.app;  //REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR package name

    import android.app.Application;
    import com.parse.Parse;

    public class MainApplication extends Application {
	    @Override
        public void onCreate() {
            super.onCreate();
            Parse.initialize(this, "YOUR_PARSE_APPID", "YOUR_PARSE_CLIENT_KEY");
            //ParseInstallation.getCurrentInstallation().saveInBackground();
        }
    }
    ```
4. The final step is to register MainApplication in AndroidManifest.xml so it's used instead of the default.
In the `<application>` tag, add the attribute `android:name="MainApplication"`. Obviously, you don't have
to name your application class this way, but you have to use the same name in 3 and 4. 

Usage
-----
Once the device is ready, call ```ParsePushPlugin.register()```. This will register the device with Parse, 
you should see this reflected in your Parse control panel. Once registered, the ParsePushPlugin object
will trigger the ```receivePN``` event and optionally the ```receivePN:customEvt``` event. ```customEvt``` 
is the string value of a special key in your push notification. You can set that key in ```register()``` with
the option ```eventKey```.

```javascript
	ParsePushPlugin.register({
	appId:"PARSE_APPID", clientKey:"PARSE_CLIENT_KEY", eventKey:"myEventKey"}, //will trigger receivePN[pnObj.myEventKey]
	function() {
		alert('successfully registered device!');
	}, function(e) {
		alert('error registering device: ' + e);
	});
```

After the registration is completed successfully (it's successCB has been called), you can do any of the following
```javascript
    ParsePushPlugin.getInstallationId(function(id) {
	    alert(id);
    }, function(e) {
	    alert('error');
    });
    
    ParsePushPlugin.getSubscriptions(function(subscriptions) {
	    alert(subscriptions);
    }, function(e) {
	    alert('error');
    });

    ParsePushPlugin.subscribe('SampleChannel', function(msg) {
	    alert('OK');
    }, function(e) {
	    alert('error');
    });

    ParsePushPlugin.unsubscribe('SampleChannel', function(msg) {
	    alert('OK');
    }, function(e) {
	    alert('error');
    });
```

Anywhere in your code, you can set a listener for notification events using the ParsePushPlugin object (it extends Parse.Events).
```javascript
	ParsePushPlugin.on('receivePN', function(pn){
		alert('yo i got this push notification:' + JSON.stringify(pn));
	});
	
	//you can also listen to your own custom subevents if you have already registered the eventKey
	ParsePushPlugin.on('receivePN:chat', chatEventHandler);
	ParsePushPlugin.on('receivePN:serverMaintenance', serverMaintenanceHandler);
```


Silent Notifications
--------------------
For Android, a silent notification can be sent by omitting the `title` and `alert` fields in the
JSON payload. This means the push notification will not be shown in the system tray, but its JSON
payload will still be delivered to your `receivePN` and `receivePN:customEvt` handlers.
